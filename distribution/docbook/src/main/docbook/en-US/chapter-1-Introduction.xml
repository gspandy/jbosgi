        <emphasis role="strong">What does OSGi offer to Java developers?</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>OSGi modules provide classloader semantics to partially expose code that can then be consumed by other modules. The implementation details of a module, although scoped public by the Java programming language, remain private to the module. On top of that you can install multiple versions of the same code and resolve dependencies by version and other criteria. OSGi also offers advanced lifecycle and services layers, which are explained in more detail further down.</para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">What kind of applications benefit from OSGi?</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>Any application that is designed in a modular fashion where it is necessary to start, stop, update individual modules with minimal impact on other modules. Modules can define their own transitive dependencies without the need to resolve these dependencies at the container level.</para>

      <para>The functionality of the Framework is divided in the following layers:</para>

      </para>
      <para>The OSGi Security Layer is an optional layer that underlies the OSGi Service Platform. The layer is based on the Java 2 security architecture. It provides the infrastructure to deploy and manage applications that must run in fine grained controlled environments.</para>
      <para>The OSGi Service Platform can authenticate code in the following ways:</para>

      </itemizedlist>
      <para>For example, an Operator can grant the ACME company the right to use networking on their devices. The ACME company can then use networking in every bundle they digitally sign and deploy on the Operatorâ€™s device. Also, a specific bundle can be granted permission to only manage the life cycle of bundles that are signed by the ACME company.</para>

        The current version of JBoss OSGi does not provide this optional layer. If you would like to see this implemented, let us know on the forums:

        <emphasis role="strong">OSGi Module Layer</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>The OSGi Module Layer provides a generic and standardized solution for Java modularization. The Framework defines a unit of modularization, called a bundle. A bundle is comprised of Java classes and other resources, which together can provide functions to end users. Bundles can share Java packages among an exporter bundle and an importer bundle in a well-defined way.</para>
      <para>Once a Bundle is started, its functionality is provided and services are exposed to other bundles installed in the OSGi Service Platform. A bundle carries descriptive information about itself in the manifest file that is contained in its JAR file. Here are a few important Manifest Headers defined by the OSGi Framework:</para>

          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>The notion of OSGi Version Range describes a range of versions using a mathematical interval notation. For example</para>
      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>Import-Package: com.acme.foo;version="[1.23, 2)", com.acme.bar;version="[4.0, 5.0)"</programlisting>
      </informalexample>
      <para>With the OSGi Class Loading Architecture many bundles can share a single virtual machine (VM). Within this VM, bundles can hide packages and classes from other bundles, as well as share packages with other bundles.</para>

      </para>
      <para>For example, the following import and export definition resolve correctly because the version range in the import definition matches the version in the export definition:</para>
      <informalexample>

        </figure>
      </para>
      <para>Apart from bundle versions, OSGi Attribute Matching is a generic mechanism to allow the importer and exporter to influence the matching process in a declarative way. For example, the following statements will match.</para>
      <informalexample>
        <programlisting>A: Import-Package: com.acme.foo;company=ACME
    B: Export-Package: com.acme.foo;company=ACME; security=false</programlisting>
      </informalexample>
      <para>An exporter can limit the visibility of the classes in a package with the include and exclude directives on the export definition.</para>

      </para>
      <para>The OSGi Service Layer defines a dynamic collaborative model that is highly integrated with the Life Cycle Layer. The service model is a publish, find and bind model. A service is a normal Java object that is registered under one or more Java interfaces with the service registry. OSGi services are dynamic, they can come and go at any time. OSGi service consumers, when written correctly, can deal with this dynamicity. This means that OSGi services provide the capability to create a highly adaptive application which, when written using services, can even be updated at runtime without taking the service consumers down.</para>
      <para>
        The
        <link linkend="sid-4784847_Introduction-DS">OSGi Declarative Services</link>
        and
        <link linkend="sid-4784847_Introduction-blueprint">OSGi Blueprint</link>
        specifications significantly simplify the use of OSGi Services which means that a consumer gets the benefits of a dynamic services model for very little effort.

        The OSGi Service Compendium is described in the
        <ulink url="http://www.osgi.org/Specifications/HomePage">OSGi Compendium and Enterprise specifications</ulink>

Although the OSGi Core Framework specification is useful in itself already, it only defines the OSGi core infrastructure. The services defined in the compendium specification define the scope and functionality of some common services that bundle developers might want to use. Here is a quick summary of the popular ones:

        The Declarative Services (DS) specification describes a component model to be used with OSGi services.

        The OSGi Blueprint Specification describes a component framework which simplifies working with OSGi services significantly. To a certain extent, Blueprint and
        <link linkend="sid-4784847_Introduction-DS">DS</link>
        have goals in common, but the realization is different. One of the main differences between Blueprint and DS is in the way service-consumer components react to a change in the availability of required services. In the case of DS the service-consumer will disappear when its required dependencies disappear, while in Blueprint the component stays around and waits for a replacement service to appear. Each model has its uses and it can be safely said that both Blueprint as well as DS each have their supporters. The Blueprint specification was heavily influenced by the Spring framework.

      <para>OSGi Remote Services add distributed computing to the OSGi service programming model. Where in an ordinary OSGi Framework services are strictly local to the Java VM, with Remote Services the services can be remote. Services are registered and looked up just like local OSGi services, the Remote Services specifications define standard service properties to indicate that a service is suitable for remoting and to find out whether a service reference is a local one or a remote one.</para>
